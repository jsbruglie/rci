## TODO:
* Wait for the professor to give us an Identity Server
* Get rmb to publish a msg to msgserv successfully
* Get msgserver to get a message from rmb with a server list requests and answer successfully
* Use a thread for the interfaces and another for the respective server services in msgserv (rmb can also have the same thing)
